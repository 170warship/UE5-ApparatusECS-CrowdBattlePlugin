This project is the beta version, so bugs may occur.

The project itself is open sourced. However the project is based on the Apparatus ECS framework on FAB, which is not free.

This project also has dependency on the Flowfield Canvas plugin. The plugin itself is not free also. But this project has included a free lite version of Flowfield Canvas.

This project is developed and tested on UE5.3 on Windows.
