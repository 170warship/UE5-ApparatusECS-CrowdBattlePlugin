Dependencies:

The plugin itself is open sourced. However the plugin is based on the Apparatus ECS framework on FAB, which is not cheap.

This plugin also depends on my pathfinding plugin Flowfield Canvas, which is also for sale on FAB. But i have included a lite version for free, with basic functionalities included. You can support my work by purchasing it down here:

This plugin needs the Anim To Texture plugin, which is an official plugin included in the engine.
