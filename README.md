Please use the release version beta.4, which is up to date.

This plugin is the beta version, so bugs may occur.

The plugin itself is open sourced. However the plugin is developed with the Apparatus ECS framework on FAB, which is not cheap.

This plugin also has dependency on the Flowfield Canvas plugin, which is also for sale on FAB. However this plugin has included a lite version of Flowfield Canvas for free, with all the basic functionalities.

This plugin relies on Anim To Texture plugin, which is an official plugin included in the engine.

This plugin is developed and tested by UE5.3 5.4 5.5 on Windows.

The performance test result is 60+fps running 10000 agents and 30+fps running 30000 agents on AMD Ryzen 5900X and rts4080S, cpu capped.

This plugin uses ecs for logic and niagara + vat as the rendering solution.

This plugin uses rvo2 for avoidance/collision.

This plugin uses neighbour grid for collision detection and flow field for navigation.

This plugin includes an editor utility widget that allows users to set up a new agent with only 1 click of a button.
